# Ganache Core

This is the core code that powers the Ganache application and the the Ganache command line tool.

# INSTALLATION

`ganache-core` is written in JavaScript and distributed as a Node.js package via `npm`. Make sure you have Node.js (>= v8.9.0) installed, and your environment is capable of installing and compiling `npm` modules.

**macOS** Make sure you have the XCode Command Line Tools installed. These are needed in general to be able to compile most C based languages on your machine, as well as many npm modules.

**Windows** See our [Windows install instructions](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/wiki/Installing-ganache-cli-on-Windows).

**Ubuntu/Linux** Follow the basic instructions for installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) and make sure that you have `npm` installed, as well as the `build-essential` `apt` package (it supplies `make` which you will need to compile most things). Use the official Node.js packages, *do not use the package supplied by your distribution.*

Using npm:

```Bash
npm install ganache-core
```

or, if you are using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```Bash
yarn add ganache-core
```


# USAGE

As a [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) provider:

```javascript
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
web3.setProvider(ganache.provider());
```

As an [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) provider:

```javascript
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(ganache.provider());
```

As a general HTTP and WebSocket server:

```javascript
const ganache = require("ganache-core");
const server = ganache.server();
server.listen(port, function(err, blockchain) {...});
```

Both `.provider()` and `.server()` take a single object which allows you to specify behavior of the Ganache instance. This parameter is optional. Available options are:

* `"accounts"`: `Array` of `Object`'s. Each object should have a `balance` key with a hexadecimal value. The key `secretKey` can also be specified, which represents the account's private key. If no `secretKey`, the address is auto-generated with the given balance. If specified, the key is used to determine the account's address.
* `"debug"`: `boolean` - Output VM opcodes for debugging
* `"blockTime"`: `number` - Specify blockTime in seconds for automatic mining. If you don't specify this flag, ganache will instantly mine a new block for every transaction. Using the `blockTime` option is discouraged unless you have tests which require a specific mining interval.
* `"logger"`: `Object` - Object, like `console`, that implements a `log()` function.
* `"mnemonic"`: Use a specific HD wallet mnemonic to generate initial addresses.
* `"port"`: Port number to listen on when running as a server.
* `"seed"`: Use arbitrary data to generate the HD wallet mnemonic to be used.
* `"default_balance_ether"`: `number` - The default account balance, specified in ether.
* `"total_accounts"`: `number` - Number of accounts to generate at startup.
* `"fork"`: `string` or `object` - When a `string`, same as `--fork` option above. Can also be a Web3 Provider object, optionally used in conjunction with the `fork_block_number` option below.
* `"fork_block_number"`: `string` or `number` - Block number the provider should fork from, when the `fork` option is specified. If the `fork` option is specified as a string including the `@` sign and a block number, the block number in the `fork` parameter takes precedence.
* `"network_id"`: Specify the network id ganache-core will use to identify itself (defaults to the current time or the network id of the forked blockchain if configured)
* `"time"`: `Date` - Date that the first block should start. Use this feature, along with the `evm_increaseTime` method to test time-dependent code.
* `"locked"`: `boolean` - whether or not accounts are locked by default.
* `"unlocked_accounts"`: `Array` - array of addresses or address indexes specifying which accounts should be unlocked.
* `"db_path"`: `String` - Specify a path to a directory to save the chain database. If a database already exists, `ganache-core` will initialize that chain instead of creating a new one.
* `"db"`: `Object` - Specify an alternative database instance, for instance [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown).
* `"ws"`: Enable a websocket server. This is `true` by default.
* `"account_keys_path"`: `String` - Specifies a file to save accounts and private keys to, for testing.
* `"vmErrorsOnRPCResponse"`: `boolean` - Whether or not to transmit transaction failures as RPC errors. Set to `false` for error reporting behaviour which is compatible with other clients such as geth and Parity. This is `true` by default to replicate the error reporting behavior of previous versions of ganache.
* `"hdPath"`: The hierarchical deterministic path to use when generating accounts. Default: "m/44'/60'/0'/0/"
* `"hardfork"`: Allows to specify which hardfork should be used. Supported hardforks are `byzantium`, `constantinople`, and `petersburg` (default).
* `"allowUnlimitedContractSize"`: `boolean` - Allows unlimited contract sizes while debugging. By setting this to `true`, the check within the EVM for contract size limit of 24KB (see [EIP-170](https://git.io/vxZkK)) is bypassed. Setting this to `true` **will** cause `ganache-core` to behave differently than production environments. (default: `false`; **ONLY** set to `true` during debugging).
* `"gasPrice"`: Sets the default gas price for transactions if not otherwise specified. Must be specified as a hex string in wei. Defaults to `"0x77359400"`, or 2 gwei.
* `"gasLimit"`: Sets the block gas limit. Must be specified as a hex string. Defaults to `"0x6691b7"`.
* `"keepAliveTimeout"`: If using `.server()` - Sets the HTTP server's `keepAliveTimeout` in milliseconds. See the [NodeJS HTTP docs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_keepalivetimeout) for details. `5000` by default.

There’s also special non-standard methods that aren’t included within the original RPC specification:

* `evm_snapshot` : Snapshot the state of the blockchain at the current block. Takes no parameters. Returns the integer id of the snapshot created. A snapshot can only be used once. After a successful `evm_revert`, the same snapshot id cannot be used again. Consider creating a new snapshot after each `evm_revert` if you need to revert to the same point multiple times.
* `evm_revert` : Revert the state of the blockchain to a previous snapshot. Takes a single parameter, which is the snapshot id to revert to. If no snapshot id is passed it will revert to the latest snapshot. Returns `true`.
* `evm_increaseTime` : Jump forward in time. Takes one parameter, which is the amount of time to increase in seconds. Returns the total time adjustment, in seconds.
* `evm_mine` : Force a block to be mined. Takes one optional parameter, which is the timestamp a block should setup as the mining time. Mines a block independent of whether or not mining is started or stopped.

# UNSUPPORTED METHODS

* `eth_compileSolidity`: If you'd like Solidity compilation in Javascript, please see the [solc-js project](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js).
